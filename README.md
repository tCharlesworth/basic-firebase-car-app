# basic-firebase-car-app

This is a simple app for demonstrating the use of Firebase to save data about cars. We used angular-ui-router for routing and firebase
for saving data. This is a working solution to DevMountain's carFire project located [here](https://github.com/DevMountain/carFire)

**For this code to work properly you need to open the `carsSvc.js` file and fix the url to point to a firebase url.
